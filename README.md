# MedicalChain - Secure Medical Records on Blockchain

## Project Description

MedicalChain is a blockchain-based solution for secure and efficient management of patient treatment records using Aptos Move. The system provides a decentralized infrastructure for healthcare providers to create, store, and update patient treatment plans while maintaining strict access controls and data integrity.

The core `PatientTreatment` module enables authorized doctors to:
- Register themselves on the platform
- Create detailed treatment plans for patients
- Securely update existing treatment records
- Track patient history with immutable timestamps

MedicalChain leverages blockchain's inherent security features to protect sensitive medical data while providing transparent, auditable access control mechanisms.

## Project Vision

Our vision for MedicalChain is to transform healthcare data management by:

1. **Enhancing Data Security**: Protecting sensitive patient information through blockchain's cryptographic security and immutable record-keeping.

2. **Improving Interoperability**: Creating a standardized system where healthcare providers can securely share patient data across institutions.

3. **Empowering Patients**: Eventually expanding the platform to give patients visibility and appropriate control over their own medical records.

4. **Streamlining Compliance**: Building regulatory compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.) directly into the system's architecture.

5. **Enabling Medical Research**: Creating infrastructure for anonymous, consented data sharing to advance medical research.

MedicalChain aims to be the foundation for a new healthcare ecosystem where data is secure, accessible to authorized parties, and ultimately serves to improve patient outcomes through better information management.

## Technical Implementation

The current implementation includes:
- A Move module for the Aptos blockchain
- Core data structures for treatments and doctor registration
- Access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized parties can view or modify records
- Timestamp-based record keeping for audit trails

## Future Development

- Patient consent management system
- Multi-signature requirements for critical record changes
- Integration with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems
- Analytics capabilities for healthcare providers
- Patient-facing interfaces
